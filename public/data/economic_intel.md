Economic intelligence involves analysing financial indicators, policies, and markets to anticipate risks and opportunities. It supports decision-making for governments, investors, and corporations by turning raw data into actionable insight. Key tools include inflation tracking, interest rate forecasting, and supply chain monitoring.

Increased interest rates by central banks in the US, UK, and EU have cooled inflation but also raised borrowing costs, particularly for emerging markets with high external debt. Exchange rate volatility—driven by geopolitical instability and capital flow shifts—continues to affect trade balances and commodity pricing.

Sanctions have become an increasingly used policy lever, especially targeting Russian and Iranian sectors. However, their effectiveness depends on enforcement, third-party cooperation, and the resilience of target economies. Black market networks, offshore banking, and digital currencies complicate sanctions tracking.

Energy prices remain a key driver of economic uncertainty. Disruptions to shipping routes in the Red Sea or supply constraints in LNG markets have a ripple effect on manufacturing and food prices globally. Economic analysts track futures markets and shipping indexes to anticipate movements.

Global financial fragmentation is a growing concern. The decoupling of US and Chinese tech and finance ecosystems—coupled with currency diversification by states like Saudi Arabia—signals a move away from unipolar financial governance. These shifts affect everything from SWIFT transactions to sovereign reserve strategies.
