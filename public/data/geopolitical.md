Geopolitics is the study of how geography, power, and international dynamics interact. Nations make strategic decisions based on resource access, border vulnerabilities, alliance structures, and ideological influence. Events rarely occur in isolation—they reflect deeper patterns of strategic interest and historical precedent.

The Russia–Ukraine war has realigned European defence policy, re-energised NATO, and triggered energy and grain supply disruptions far beyond Eastern Europe. China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea, its military posture near Taiwan, and the expansion of the Belt and Road Initiative represent parallel challenges to US and Western influence.

Emerging alliances such as BRICS+ aim to counterbalance US-led institutions. Economic diplomacy, infrastructure lending, and energy partnerships are now used as tools of geopolitical influence. Africa has become a contested space for diplomatic and economic engagement, with Gulf states, China, and Western powers all vying for presence.

Geopolitical forecasting requires scenario planning and consideration of wildcard events—such as leadership changes, surprise invasions, or natural disasters—that can shift the strategic balance. Intelligence agencies often model indicators and warnings (I&W) to assess whether tensions are escalating towards conflict.

In modern strategy, information operations and cyber influence campaigns play roles equal to tanks or missiles. The battle for narrative control—through media manipulation, diplomatic framing, or soft power tools—can shape outcomes without a shot being fired.
